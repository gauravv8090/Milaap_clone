                <p>My name is Shiv Sagar Prasad and I am here to raise funds for my brother Rajeev Kumar, who is 37 years old and an alumni of IIT Madras, Chennai (B.Tech 2008 batch). He was a struggling entrepreneur and lived in Bengaluru, Karnataka with his spouse and 2-month-old son when he met with a road traffic accident on 27th Jan'2022. <br><br>

                    He is suffering from severe Traumatic Brain Injury and is currently admitted and receiving ICU Care at Sakra World Hospital, Bengaluru, Karnataka after undergoing several brain surgeries and treatments at New Janpriya hospital, Manipal hospital and NIMHANS hospital. He has been in COMA for the last 6 months. He is still critical on ventilator support and battling for his life. <br><br>
                    
                    Until now, we have spent approx. Rs50,00,000/- We have arranged this amount from savings & loans. <br><br>
                    
                    In the next few days, we need Rs75,00,000/- more for further treatment. Please come forward to support my cause. Any contribution will be of immense help. Do contribute and share this crowdfunding fundraiser link with your friends and family. <br><br>
                    
                    I want to see him back as he looks in the profile smiley picture. <br><br>
